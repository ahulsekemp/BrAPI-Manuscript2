## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Population growth and climate change require extraordinary efforts to increase efficiency in breeding programs around the world. In the last few years, genomics technologies and genomic prediction approaches have provided a boost in genetic gain in breeding, but has also created a flood of data that needs careful management to be fully harnessed.
The Breeding API (BrAPI) project is an international, grass-roots effort to enable more efficient data management by enabling interoperability among plant breeding databases and tools, using a standardized RESTful web service API specification for communicating plant breeding data.
This community driven standard is free to be used by anyone interested in plant breeding data management, including trial data, phenotypic data and genotyping data management.
This manuscript describes advances in implementations of BrAPI in different breeding tools, and outlook for the current version of BrAPI.
