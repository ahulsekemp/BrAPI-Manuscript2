## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Population growth and climate change require extraordinary efforts to increase efficiency in breeding programs around the world. In the last few years, new phenotyping techniques, genomics technologies, and genetic approaches such as genomic prediction have provided a boost in genetic gain in breeding, but have also created a flood of data that needs careful management to be fully harnessed. In particular, data integration is a challenge due to the multiple types of data being handled by a variety of disparate and dispersed systems. 
The Breeding API (BrAPI) project is an international, grass-roots effort to enable more efficient data management by enabling interoperability among research databases and tools, using a standardized RESTful web service API specification for exchanging breeding related data.
This community driven standard is software agnostic and free to be used by anyone interested in plant breeding, genetics and agronomy data management, including trial, germplasm, phenotyping, and genotyping data management.
This manuscript presents the substantial growth of the project, a wide variety of open source breeding research tools with active BrAPI implementations, and an overview about the current version of BrAPI.
