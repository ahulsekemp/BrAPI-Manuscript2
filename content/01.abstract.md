## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Population growth and climate change require extraordinary efforts to increase efficiency in breeding programs around the world. In the last few years, new phenotyping techniques, genomics technologies, and genomic prediction approaches have provided a boost in genetic gain in breeding, but have also created a flood of data that needs careful management to be fully harnessed. Data integration is a significant challenge with multiple types of data being collected and stored by a variety of disparate systems. 
The Breeding API (BrAPI) project is an international, grass-roots effort to enable more efficient data management by enabling interoperability among research databases and tools, using a standardized RESTful web service API specification for communicating breeding related data.
This community driven standard is software agnostic and free to be used by anyone interested in breeding data management, including trial, germplasm, phenotypic, and genotyping data management.
This manuscript presents the current version of BrAPI, the substantial growth of the project, and a wide variety of open source breeding research tools with active BrAPI implementations.
