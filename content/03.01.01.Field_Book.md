#### Field Book

<!-- Trevor and Chaney -->
Phenotypic data collection underpins scientific crop research and plant breeding. Knowledge gained from collected data and its analysis alongside data visualizations inform further phenotypic trials and ideally support research hypotheses. The importance of accuracy and efficiency in the collection of this data as well as the infrastructure to facilitate the flow of data from the field to a knowledge base cannot be underestimated. 

Historically, gathering data in the field was done with pen and paper, or perhaps some version of a digital spreadsheet. The abundance and prevalence of smart phones has allowed the Field Book mobile app [@doi:10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0579] to enhance data collection. Field Book can create well-formed digital observation records from the moment they are taken. This can improve the efficiency of data collection and reduce human error. 

In 2018, BrAPI was introduced into Field Book; specifically, the Core and Phenotyping modules. BrAPI was able to take things a step further by automating the flow of data from the Field Book mobile app to a central database server. This workflow allows data collection and storage to be expedited, removing the need of the user to transfer export files manually. Since Field Bookâ€™s adoption of BrAPI, many community servers have been integrated to simplify data storage. In this work flow, data is collected and stored completely digitally with little-to-no human involvement.
