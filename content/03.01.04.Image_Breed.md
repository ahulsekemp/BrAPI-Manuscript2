#### ImageBreed

High-throughput phenotyping has been gaining significant traction lately as a way to collect lots of data very quickly. Image collection from unmanned aerial and ground vehicles (UAVs and UGVs) are a great way to collect a lot of raw data all at once, then analyze it later. ImageBreed [@doi:10.1002/ppj2.20004] is an image collection pipeline tool to support regular use of UAVs and UGVs. 

When the raw images have been processed through the standardization pipelines in ImageBreed, useful phenotypes can be extracted from the images. The BrAPI standard is used to push these phenotypes back to a central breeding database where they can be analyzed with other data. In addition to this, ImageBreed has the ability to use BrAPI to upload the raw images to the central breeding database, or any other BrAPI compatible long term storage service. In the current version of the standard (V2.1), the BrAPI data models for images are rudimentary, but effective. The ImageBreed team has put in some work into enhancing the BrAPI image data standards, collaborating with others in the community.
