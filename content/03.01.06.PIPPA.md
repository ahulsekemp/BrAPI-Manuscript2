#### PIPPA

<!-- Rafael -->
[PIPPA](https://pippa.psb.ugent.be) [@https://pippa.psb.ugent.be] is a data management system used for collecting data from the [WIWAM](https://www.wiwam.be/) [@https://www.wiwam.be] range of automated high throughput phenotyping platforms. These platforms have been deployed at different research institutes and commercial breeders across Europe. They can be setup in a variety of configurations with different types of equipment including weighing scales, cameras, and environment sensors. The software features a web interface with functionality for setting up new experiments, planning imaging and irrigation treatments, linking metadata to pots (genotype, growth media, manual treatments), importing data, exporting data, and visualizing data. It also supports the integration of image analysis scripts and connections to a compute cluster for job submission.

To share the phenotype data of the experiments linked to publications, an implementation of BrAPI v1.3 was developed which allowed read only access to the data in the BrAPI standardized format. This server was registered on [FAIDARE](https://urgi.versailles.inrae.fr/faidare/) [@https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04425516] which allows the data to be found alongside data from other BrAPI compatible repositories.

As the BrAPI ecosystem has matured, it has created a clear path for the further development of PIPPA. The BrAPI specification demonstrates how to share data in a manner consistent with the FAIR principles, [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18] which are becoming best practices in plant research data management. The BrAPI technical standard, in combination with the [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/) [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544] scientific standard, have served as guidelines in the current development effort of the PIPPA project. This development is focused on delivering a public BrAPI v2.1 endpoint and making more high throughput datasets publicly available via BrAPI.
