#### Trait Selector BrAPP

<!-- Mirella & Valentin -->
<!-- the "BrAPP" description part should better fit at the beginning of the section. -->
<!-- BrAPPs are simple tools developed by the BrAPI community that are entirely reliant on BrAPI for their data requirements. Often, they are JavaScript based applications or visualizations that fit on a single web page. This means a single BrAPP can be easily shared and used by many organizations and systems, as long as those organizations have the standard BrAPI endpoints available. -->

The [Trait Selector BrAPP](https://github.com/solgenomics/BrAPI-Trait-selector) is used to search and select meaningful traits, with a visual aid to help the user find exactly what they need. Instead of searching through a long list of possible traits, the user is presented with a cartoon image of a species. They can then click on pieces of the image to show traits associated to that part of the plant. For a breeder, they might use it to quickly find specific traits to study. For a genebank user, they might use it to find varieties that have a specific trait they are interested in.

The Trait Selector can be integrated into any website or system, assuming there is a BrAPI compatible data source available to connect to. A breeding database would need to only implement the BrAPI endpoints for Traits, Observations, and Variables, while a genebank would require Traits and Germplasm Attributes. Any BrAPI server with either of these sets of endpoints implemented could use this BrAPP. CassavaBase and MGIS are two successful examples of the Trait Selector BrAPP in use.
