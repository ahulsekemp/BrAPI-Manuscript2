#### Flapjack

[Flapjack](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/flapjack) [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq580] is a multi-platform desktop application for data visualization and breeding analysis (e.g., pedigree verification, marker-assisted backcrossing and forward breeding) using high-throughput genotype data. 
Data can be imported into Flapjack from any BrAPI-compatible data source with genotype data available.
[Flapjack Bytes](https://github.com/cropgeeks/flapjack-bytes) is a smaller, lightweight, and fully web-based counterpart to Flapjack that can be easily embedded into a database website to provide similar visualizations online. 
Traditionally supporting its own text-based data formats, Flapjack's use of BrAPI has streamlined the end-user experience for data import.
Work is underway to determine the best methods to exchange analysis results using future versions of the API.
