In the global system for ex situ conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR) [@doi:10.3390/plants10081557], a total of ~5.8 million accessions are conserved in 1750 ex situ genebanks [@doi:10.2135/cropsci2017.01.0014]. Unique and permanent identifiers in the form of DOIs are available for more than 1.7 million accessions [@{https://glis.fao.org/glis/}]. Each DOI is linked to some basic descriptive data that facilitates the use of these resources. Many DOIs are also linked to additional data from different domains or will be in the future. However, a data space beyond the most basic information is needed that includes genotypic and phenotypic data. This space will help answer questions on the global biological diversity of a plant species, on duplicate detection, on provenance tracking for the identification of genetic integrity, on the selection of the most suitable material for various purposes, and to support further applications in data mining or AI. In this context, the aim of the [AGENT project](https://www.agent-project.eu/), funded by the European Commission, is to develop a concept for the digital exploitation and activation of this PGR data space, [@doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.18] and to test it in practice using two important crops, barley and wheat. Thirteen European genebanks and five bioinformatics centers are cooperating and have agreed on standards and protocols for the data flow and data formats [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.109080.2] for central archiving of genotypic and phenotypic data.

The BrAPI specification is one of the agreed standards. The implemented BrAPI interface enables AGENT to mine current and historic genotypic and phenotypic information. This will drive the discovery of genes, traits, and knowledge for future missions. The AGENT database backend aggregates curated passport data, phenotypic data, and genotypic data about wheat and barley accessions from the 18 project partners. This data is integrated via [BrAPI endpoints](https://github.com/AGENTproject/BrAPI) and explorable in a [web portal](https://agent.ipk-gatersleben.de). Genotyping data uses the DivBrowse [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giad025] storage engine and its BrAPI interface. Soon, the BrAPI implementation will be expanded to enable the integration of analysis pipelines in the AGENT portal, such as the FIGS+ pipeline developed by ICARDA [@doi:10.22004/AG.ECON.266624].
