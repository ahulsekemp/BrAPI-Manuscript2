### Breeding and Genetics Data Management

While specialty data management is important for some use cases, often breeders want a central repository or access point of critical data. General breeding and genetics data management systems and web portals support some level of phenotypic, genotypic, and germplasm data, as well as trial, equipment, and people management. By enabling BrAPI support, these larger systems can connect with smaller tools and specialty systems to provide more functionality under the same user interface. There are several breeding data management systems developed in the BrAPI community, each with their own strengths.
