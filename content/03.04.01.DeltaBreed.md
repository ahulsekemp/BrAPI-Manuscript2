#### DeltaBreed

<!-- Shawn Y.-->
DeltaBreed is an open-source breeding data management system designed and developed by Breeding Insight to support USDA-ARS specialty crop and animal breeders. DeltaBreed differs from other related systems in that is customizable to small breeding teams and generalized enough to support the workflows of diverse niche species. DeltaBreed is a unified system that connects a variety of BrAPI applications (see list below). BrAPI integration allows the complexity underlying interoperability to be hidden, shielding users from multifactorial differences between various applications. DeltaBreed, adhering to the BrAPI model, establishes data standards and validations for users and provides a singular framework for data management and user training. 

DeltaBreed users need not be aware of BrAPI or the specifics of underlying applications but will notice that BrAPI interoperability reduces the need for human-mediated file transfers and data manipulation. Field Book users, for example, can connect to their DeltaBreed program, authenticate, and pull studies and traits directly from DeltaBreed to Field Book on their data collection device. The subsequent step of pushing observations from Field Book to DeltaBreed is straightforward via BrAPI, but is pending implementation until observation transaction handling is improved, intentional and inadvertent repeated measures are differentiated, and a data staging area is implemented for quality control.

Breeding Insight integrated several BrAPI applications to support 2021 phenotypic data collection by USDA-ARS blueberry breeders. DeltaBreed was used to create traits in Breedbase, and Field Book was used to pull studies and traits from Breedbase. The workflow also permitted users to push Field Book observations back to Breedbase via BrAPI. This effort served as a successful proof of concept for multi-application BrAPI integration, but highlighted limitations to the process of accepting BrAPI observations from Field Book. The Breeding Insight team is actively working with the rest of the BrAPI community to correct these limitations in future versions of the specification.

DeltaBreed is integrated with many other BrAPI community projects and tools. There is a BrAPI enabled connection, either in development or production, with all of the following tools: [BrAPI Java Test Server](https://test-server.brapi.org/brapi/v2/), [BreedBase](https://breedbase.org/), [Field Book](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fieldbook.tracker), [Gigwa](https://gigwa.southgreen.fr/gigwa/), [QBMS](https://icarda-git.github.io/QBMS), [Mr Bean](https://github.com/AparicioJohan/MrBeanApp), [Helium](https://helium.hutton.ac.uk/#/) and the [Pedigree Viewer](https://github.com/solgenomics/BrAPI-Pedigree-Viewer) BrAPP.
