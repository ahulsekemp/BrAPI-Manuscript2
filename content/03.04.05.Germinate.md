#### Germinate

<!-- Sebastian R -->
[Germinate](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/) [@doi:10.1002/csc2.20248] is an open-source plant genetic resources database that combines and integrates various kinds of plant breeding data including genotypic data, phenotypic trials data, passport data, images, geographic information and climate data into a single repository. Germinate is tightly linked to the BrAPI specification and supports a majority of BrAPI endpoints for querying, filtering, and submission.

Germinate integrates and connects with other BrAPI-enabled tools such as GridScore for phenotypic data collection, Flapjack for genotypic data visualization, and Helium for pedigree visualization. Additionally, due to the nature of BrAPI, Germinate can act as a data repository for any BrAPI-compatible tool. Thanks to the interoperability provided by BrAPI, the need for manual data handling becomes a rarity with the direct benefit of faster data processing, fewer to no human errors, data security, and data integrity.
