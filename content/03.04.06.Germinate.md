[Germinate](https://ics.hutton.ac.uk/get-germinate/) [@doi:10.1002/csc2.20248;@doi:10.2135/cropsci2016.09.0814] is an open-source plant genetic resources database that combines and integrates various types of plant breeding data including genotypic, phenotypic, passport, image, geographic, and climate data into a single repository. 
Germinate is tightly linked to the BrAPI specification and supports the majority of BrAPI endpoints for querying, filtering, and submission.

Germinate connects with other BrAPI-enabled tools such as GridScore for phenotypic data collection, Flapjack for genotypic data visualization, and Helium for pedigree visualization. 
Additionally, due to the nature of BrAPI, Germinate can act as a data repository for any BrAPI-compatible tool. 
The interoperability provided by BrAPI reduces the need for manual data handling, providing the direct benefits of faster data processing, fewer human errors, and improved data security and integrity.
