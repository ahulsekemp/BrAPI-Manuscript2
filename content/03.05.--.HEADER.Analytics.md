Modern breeding programs can utilize data management systems to maintain both phenotypic and genotypic data. Numerous systems are available for adoption. To fully leverage the benefits of digitalization in this ecosystem, breeders need to utilize data from different sources to make efficient data-driven decisions. With increased computational power at their disposal, scientists can construct more advanced analysis pipelines by combining various data sources.

The tools developed by the BrAPI community can pull in data from multiple BrAPI compatible data sources and provide enhanced analytical functionality. In many cases, there is no longer a need to import and export large data files to a local computational environment just to run standard analytical models. These tools are able to extract the data they need from a data source without much human intervention or human error.
