### Analytics

While other tools listed above have the capability to do specialized analytics on certain types of data, general analytics tools can cover a wide range of data types and analytical models. The tools developed by the BrAPI community can pull in data from multiple BrAPI compatible data sources and provide enhanced analytical functionality. In many cases, there is no longer a need to import and export large data files to a local computational environment just to run standard analytical models. These tools are able to extract the data they need from a data source without much human intervention or human error.
