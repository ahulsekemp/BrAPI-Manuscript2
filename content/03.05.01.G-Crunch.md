#### G-Crunch

<!-- Josh -->
[G-Crunch](https://github.com/CornellILCI/G-CrunchUI) is an upcoming user-facing tool to make simple, repeatable analysis requests. By using BrAPI calls to phenotypic and genotypic data sources, as well as an API currently implemented in [Analytics Framework](https://github.com/CornellILCI/af-pipeline) similar to the proposed [Analytics NCP](https://brapinewconceptpreview.docs.apiary.io/), the lightweight UI can be used to specify and window incoming data, select specific analysis criteria built into Analytics Framework, and trigger any analytics pipeline that's baked into the specific framework instance, such as sommer and ASREML based pipelines currently in Analytics Framework.

Since each piece can be separately specified, this can allow flexibility to run 'test' analyses on small data sets with small or local analytics instances, and quickly re-point G-Crunch to a larger organizational or cloud-based Analytics Framework and/or data set, without having to worry about moving data around or introducing errors in manually triggering the analysis steps.

G-Crunch, as a tool, couldn't feasibly exist without BrAPI. The support of BrAPI interfaces allows G-Crunch to use one unified request method, and adapt to the user's existing network of BrAPI-compliant tools. This lowers the barrier to entry for adoption, and makes analysis pipelines easily repeatable.
