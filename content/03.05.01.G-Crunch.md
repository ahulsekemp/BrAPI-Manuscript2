#### G-Crunch

<!-- Josh -->
G-Crunch is an upcoming user-facing analysis tool that integrates genomic and phenotypic data to fulfill the need for simple, user driven analytics requests. It includes a generic user interface and the ability to swap out data sources and analysis tools. The G-Crunch team hopes to streamline repeatable, debuggable, simple analytic requests and results.

G-Crunch, as a tool, couldn't feasibly exist without BrAPI. The support of BrAPI interfaces allows G-Crunch to use one unified request method, and adapt to the user's (BrAPI-compliant) existing network of tools. This lowers the barrier to entry for adoption, and makes analysis pipelines easily repeatable.
