#### BrAPIMapper

<!-- Valentin G: I'm planning to add a figure in supplementary data that shows data sets on a side, the mapper with some internal parts and the exposed BrAPI services. -->
[BrAPIMapper](https://github.com/plantbreeding/BrAPIMapper) is a full BrAPI implementation designed to be a convenient wrapper for any breeding related data source. BrAPIMapper is provided as a Docker application that can connect to a variety of external data sources including mySQL or PostgreSQL databases, generic REST services, flat files (XML, JSON, CSV/TSV/GFF3/VCF, YAML), or any combination of these. It provides an administration user interface to map BrAPI data models to external data sources. The interface allows administrators to select the BrAPI specification versions to use and which endpoints to enable. Data mapping configuration import and export features simplify upgrades to future BrAPI versions; administrators only have to map missing fields or make minor adjustments. BrAPIMapper supports the primary BrAPI features including paging, deferred search results, user lists, and authentication. Access restrictions to specific endpoints can be managed through the administration interface as well. This tool aims to accelerate BrAPI services deployment while ensuring specification compliance.
