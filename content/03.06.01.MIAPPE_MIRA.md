In the plant phenotyping community, [MIAPPE](https://www.miappe.org/) (Minimal Information About a Plant Phenotyping Experiment) [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544] is an established standard for phenotyping experiments. It is commonly serialized into the ISA-Tab file type. [@doi:10.1038/ng.1054] Although ISA-Tab is easy to read for non-technical experts due to its file-based approach, it lacks programmatic accessibility, particularly for web applications. BrAPI, which is aligned with MIAPPE, can help solve this problem.

[MIRA](https://github.com/USDA-ARS-GBRU/SugarcaneCrossingTool) is a tool that enables the automatic deployment of a BrAPI server on a MIAPPE-compliant dataset in ISA-Tab format. It can be deployed from a Docker image with the dataset mounted. By utilizing the mapping between MIAPPE, ISA-Tab, and BrAPI, there is no need for parsing or manual mapping of datasets that are already compliant with (meta-)data standards. By gaining programmatic access through BrAPI to these datasets, it facilitates the integration of phenotyping datasets into web applications.
