#### MIAPPE "BrAPI2ISA" service

<!-- Bert -->
Since the release of BrAPI 1.3, efforts have been made to incorporate support for the MIAPPE standard into the specification [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544]. This integration was finalized in BrAPI 2.0, resulting in full compatibility between the two standards. Consequently, BrAPI now encompasses all attributes necessary for MIAPPE compliance, adhering to standardized descriptions in accordance with MIAPPE guidelines. Leveraging BrAPI as a standardized RESTful web service API specification, we employ the ISA standard for storing metadata and phenotyping data in a standardized manner. This data is structured in the ISA-TAB file format and subjected to validation using the [MIAPPE ISA configuration](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/isatab-validation). The "BrAPI to ISA" service functions as a converter between BrAPI RESTful endpoints and ISA-TAB, facilitating the archiving of metadata and data and thereby enhancing data preservation and accessibility. The [BrAPI2ISA](https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-to-isa) tool is designed to be compatible with BrAPI 1.3, and we invite contributions from the community to extend support for the latest versions of BrAPI.
