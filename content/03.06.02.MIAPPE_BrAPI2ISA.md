#### BrAPI2ISA

<!-- Bert -->
Since the release of BrAPI 1.3, efforts have been made to incorporate support for the MIAPPE standard into the specification [@doi:10.1111/nph.16544]. This integration was finalized in BrAPI 2.0, resulting in full compatibility between the two standards. Consequently, BrAPI now encompasses all attributes necessary for MIAPPE compliance, adhering to standardized descriptions in accordance with MIAPPE guidelines. 

In some communities and projects, phenotyping data and metadata is archived and published as structured ISA-Tab files, and validated using the [MIAPPE ISA configuration](https://github.com/ELIXIR-Belgium/isatab-validation). The [BrAPI2ISA](https://github.com/elixir-europe/plant-brapi-to-isa) service functions as a converter between a BrAPI compatible server and the ISA-Tab format. This simplifies, automates, and facilitates the archiving of data, thereby enhancing data preservation and accessibility. The BrAPI2ISA tool is designed to be compatible with BrAPI 1.3, and is open to contributions from the community to extend support for the latest versions of BrAPI.
