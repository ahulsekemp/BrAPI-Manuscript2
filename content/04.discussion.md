### BrAPI for Breeders and Scientists

The BrAPI technical specification document is meant to be read and used by software developers. However, the purpose of the specification, and the community around it, is to make things faster, easier, and cheaper for the breeders and scientists working to make the world a better place. BrAPI offers a convenient path to automation and data integration for software tools in the breeding domain. All of the example use cases described above can be achieved with manual effort, moving and editing data files by hand. However, when the basic structure and flow of data becomes automated, breeders and scientists can spend less time on data management and more time focusing on the science. For many, the ultimate goal is the development of a digital ecosystem: a collection of software tools and applications that can all work together seamlessly. In this digital ecosystem, data is collected digitally from the beginning, reducing as much human error as possible. The data is checked by quality control and stored automatically, then it can be sent to any internal tool or external lab for further analysis with just the click of a button. This idea might sound too good to be true, but as more tools start sharing a universal data standard, automating data flow becomes easier, and the community gets closer to total interoperability. 

### Looking Ahead

The BrAPI specification will continue to grow, enabling more use cases and new types of data. These new use cases might include newer scientific techniques and technologies. Things like drone imaging data, spectroscopy, LIDAR, metabolomics, transcriptomics, high-throughput phenotyping, and machine learning analysis. All of these technologies can open new avenues for research and development of new crop varieties. All of these technologies also generate more data, and require data sharing between different software applications and data repositories. The BrAPI project leadership and community is committed to building the standards to support these new use cases as they arrive and become accepted by the scientific community. In fact, small groups within the BrAPI community have already start building generic data models and communication standards for many of the technologies listed above. These community efforts will eventually become part of the BrAPI standard in a future version of the specification document. 

Expanding the BrAPI specification is important for the community, however it is important not to reinvent or compete with existing functional standards. Additions to the BrAPI specification are reviewed thoroughly by the community to make sure BrAPI is compliant with existing standards and data structures. For example, BrAPI is compliant with MIAPPE, MCPD, and VCF, adding pieces of these existing popular data structures into the overall standard. In some cases, BrAPI will reference other standards instead of including them in the specification. For example, the NOAA CDO standard for weather data, or the Galaxy Analytics API for analytics pipeline controls and information. These standards are perfectly adequate on their own, and recreating them in the BrAPI standard would be redundant.    

## Conclusion

The BrAPI project only exists because of the community of breeders, software engineers, and scientists who support and use it. WHile there were many tools and use cases presented here, it is not an exhaustive list of BrAPI compliant systems. As long as the standard continues to be supported, there is potential for exponential growth of the community. As more groups make their tools BrAPI compliant, these tools can be shared with the community. As more BrAPI compliant tools are shared with the community, more groups can see the value in implementing BrAPI in their own tools. This feedback loop will allow the community to strengthen and grow.
